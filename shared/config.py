"In your FastAPI backend, update your routes and services to integrate with the newly defined LangChain.js agents.

Agent Service: Create backend/src/services/agentService.ts. This service will be responsible for coordinating the execution of the agents. It should include:

API Endpoints: In backend/src/routes/agents.ts (create this new file), define FastAPI endpoints:

POST /api/agents/monitor: Takes product_ids in the request body. Calls agentService.triggerMonitor.
POST /api/agents/analyze: Takes product_id, competitor_id. Calls agentService.triggerAnalysis.
POST /api/agents/check-alerts: Takes product_id, threshold. Calls agentService.triggerAlertCheck.
POST /api/agents/generate-report: Takes report_date. Calls agentService.generateDailyReport.

Since a zero-cost setup means likely not running these as separate full-blown services for every request, we'll focus on how your FastAPI backend could conceptually interact with them for more complex, multi-stage workflows.

Prompt for Windsurf:

Show how this endpoint would make an HTTP POST request to an external Autogen Studio or FlowiseAI API endpoint (e.g., https://your-flowise-instance.com/api/v1/prediction/<chatflow-id>).
Include example JSON payload that would pass parameters (like product_id, competitor_ids) to the external orchestration tool.
Explain how this external tool would then chain together the individual agent calls (Monitor -> Analysis -> Alert -> Report) using its visual workflow builder.

Prompt for Windsurf:

"Implement the WebSocket handler within your FastAPI backend to provide real-time updates.

WebSocket Endpoint: In backend/src/index.ts (your main server file), define a FastAPI WebSocket endpoint at /ws.

Modify your Analysis Agent (in backend/src/agents/competitorAnalysis/index.ts) so that after it completes its analysis and stores new trends/prices, it calls a broadcast function (from backend/src/utils/websocketManager.ts - create this new file).
The broadcast function should send JSON data (e.g., { type: 'PRICE_UPDATE', payload: { productId, competitorId, newPrice, oldPrice, changePercentage } }) to all connected WebSocket clients.
Real-time Alerts:
Modify your Alert Manager Agent (in backend/src/agents/alertManager/index.ts) so that after it triggers an alert, it also calls the same broadcast function.
The broadcast data should include alert details (e.g., { type: 'ALERT_TRIGGERED', payload: { alertId, productId, message, lang, timestamp } }).
Client Connection Management: In backend/src/utils/websocketManager.ts, implement:
A WebSocketManager class or functions to track active WebSocket connections.
Methods to add a client on connection, remove on disconnect, and handle WebSocket.OPEN state before sending.

"In your Next.js 14 frontend (apps/web), implement the consumption of WebSocket real-time updates.

WebSocket Hook: Create frontend/src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts. This hook should:
Connect to the /ws WebSocket endpoint on your FastAPI backend.
Manage connection state (connecting, open, closed, error).
Handle incoming JSON messages, parsing them and updating an internal state.
Implement basic reconnection logic on close or error.
Dashboard Integration:
Modify frontend/src/app/(dashboard)/page.tsx (or your main dashboard component).
Use the useWebSocket hook to subscribe to real-time updates.
Dynamically update a section (e.g., a simple list or table) to display the "Latest Price Updates" as messages of type PRICE_UPDATE come in.
Create a separate section or toast notification system to display a "Live Alert Feed" for messages of type ALERT_TRIGGERED. Ensure alerts can be displayed in both Bengali and English based on the language setting."
Progress Summary & Next Steps
Once these components are in place, you'll have a functional core for your AI Price Intelligence Dashboard:

CrewAI-like Agent Logic: Structured, tool-using agents handling monitoring, analysis, alerts, and reports.
FastAPI Backend: Orchestrating agent execution via API endpoints and serving real-time data via WebSockets.
Real-time Frontend: A dynamic dashboard displaying live price changes and alerts.
Conceptual Orchestration: A clear path for future integration with Autogen Studio or FlowiseAI for complex workflows."In your FastAPI backend, update your routes and services to integrate with the newly defined LangChain.js agents.

Agent Service: Create backend/src/services/agentService.ts. This service will be responsible for coordinating the execution of the agents. It should include:

triggerMonitor(productIds: string[]): Promise<any>
triggerAnalysis(productId: string, competitorId: string): Promise<any>
triggerAlertCheck(productId: string, threshold: number): Promise<any>
generateDailyReport(date: string): Promise<string>
These functions will import and call the respective agent functions you just defined (e.g., runMonitorAgent).
API Endpoints: In backend/src/routes/agents.ts (create this new file), define FastAPI endpoints:

POST /api/agents/monitor: Takes product_ids in the request body. Calls agentService.triggerMonitor.
POST /api/agents/analyze: Takes product_id, competitor_id. Calls agentService.triggerAnalysis.
POST /api/agents/check-alerts: Takes product_id, threshold. Calls agentService.triggerAlertCheck.
POST /api/agents/generate-report: Takes report_date. Calls agentService.generateDailyReport.
Ensure all endpoints return appropriate HTTP responses (e.g., 202 Accepted for async tasks, 200 OK for completion).
Error Handling & Logging: Implement robust try-except blocks in these endpoints and service calls. Log errors to your backend's logging system."

3. Orchestration with Autogen Studio or FlowiseAI (Conceptual/Minimal)
Since a zero-cost setup means likely not running these as separate full-blown services for every request, we'll focus on how your FastAPI backend could conceptually interact with them for more complex, multi-stage workflows.

Prompt for Windsurf:

"Provide a conceptual example or minimal code snippet in your FastAPI backend showing how it could trigger an orchestrated workflow using Autogen Studio's API or FlowiseAI's API.

FastAPI Endpoint: Create a new endpoint POST /api/orchestrate/full-cycle that initiates a comprehensive monitoring-to-report workflow.
Orchestration Logic Placeholder:
Show how this endpoint would make an HTTP POST request to an external Autogen Studio or FlowiseAI API endpoint (e.g., https://your-flowise-instance.com/api/v1/prediction/<chatflow-id>).
Include example JSON payload that would pass parameters (like product_id, competitor_ids) to the external orchestration tool.
Explain how this external tool would then chain together the individual agent calls (Monitor -> Analysis -> Alert -> Report) using its visual workflow builder.
Note: Emphasize that the actual agent logic (scraping, Prophet, etc.) remains within your FastAPI-managed backend/src/agents for efficiency and control, and Autogen/FlowiseAI would simply call these FastAPI endpoints in sequence or parallel. This decouples the orchestration from the core agent execution."

Prompt for Windsurf:

"Implement the WebSocket handler within your FastAPI backend to provide real-time updates.

The broadcast function should send JSON data (e.g., { type: 'PRICE_UPDATE', payload: { productId, competitorId, newPrice, oldPrice, changePercentage } }) to all connected WebSocket clients.
Real-time Alerts:
Modify your Alert Manager Agent (in backend/src/agents/alertManager/index.ts) so that after it triggers an alert, it also calls the same broadcast function.
The broadcast data should include alert details (e.g., { type: 'ALERT_TRIGGERED', payload: { alertId, productId, message, lang, timestamp } }).
Client Connection Management: In backend/src/utils/websocketManager.ts, implement:
A WebSocketManager class or functions to track active WebSocket connections.
Methods to add a client on connection, remove on disconnect, and handle WebSocket.OPEN state before sending.
